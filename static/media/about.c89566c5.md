<p class="description">How to find your Zive devices using this web application.</p>

## Discover devices

You can discover Zive devices connected to your local network or your computer directly.

- The chrome, firefox, or edge blocks `mixed content`, so, you have to allow `unsafe scripts` to access devices containing unsecure http contents.
- We are assuming your subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`.
- For known devices, you can add them by clicking the `Add` button.
